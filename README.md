# Text-Sentiment-Analysis
In this project, I used 3 different datasets to train a model to classify a text to be either 'positive' or 'negative'

The purpose of this project is prevent children on social media from seeing negative content (text).

Since it is dangerous to have false positives,such as showing text content promoting suicidal actions or terrorism, in this project, Precision will be my main focus instead of F1 score.
