# Text-Sentiment-Analysis
In this project, I used 3 different datasets to train a model to classify a text to be either 'positive' or 'negative'

The purpose of this project is prevent children on social media from seeing negative content (text).

Since it is dangerous to have false positives,such as showing text content promoting suicidal actions or terrorism, in this project, Precision will be my main focus instead of F1 score.


# Dataset used

1) Emotions from Text - Dataset source: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ishantjuyal/emotions-in-text

2) Tweet Emotions - Dataset source: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/pashupatigupta/emotion-detection-from-text

3) Sentiment140 - Dataset source:  http://help.sentiment140.com/for-students
This dataset comprises text content and their respective sentiments. We will be using the 
smaller dataset (for testing) for our project as the large dataset (for training) has too many 
records.The smaller dataset selected here has 498 records
